Problem solving is a ubiquitous human activity that requires individuals to identify a goal and
28 determine the steps needed to achieve it. While there are many different strategies that can be used to
29 solve a problem, individuals vary in the strategies they use (Lemaire & Lecacheur, 2010; Siegler &
30 Lemaire, 1997), raising the question of how people develop and choose the strategies they use.
31 Several theories of strategy selection explain how better performing strategies become preferred
32 (Erev & Barron, 2005; Lieder & Griffiths, 2017; Rieskamp & Otto, 2006; Shrager & Siegler, 1998).
33 Most of these theories start with some kind of task representation and a set of available strategies.
34 However, the Represent-Construct-Choose-Learn (RCCL; Lovett & Schunn, 1999) theory posits a
35 role for how changing task representations influence the generation of new strategies which in turn
36 affects strategy choices. Given this theory’s relatively broad focus on the strategy selection problem
from representation to strategy selection, the goal of the current study w 37 as to replicate and extend the
38 results of one of only two studies that have been conducted to directly assess the predictions of the
39 RCCL theory.
40 In the RCCL theory, the four main stages are as follows: (1) Represent the task, (2) Construct a set of
41 strategies based on features in the task representation, (3) Choose from among those strategies based
42 on rates of success, and (4) Learn or update success rates based on performance with experience
43 (Lovett & Schunn, 1999). The interaction of the theorized processes is shown in the left half of
44 Figure 1. This theory describes the process of how people use their task representations to learn to
45 make choices and why people might change their task representations over time. A task
46 representation in this theory is defined as a set of features that is used to encode the task
47 environment. The salience of the features in a task impacts the initial task representation by
48 determining which features might be initially selected. Then the selected features of the task
49 representation are used to generate different strategies for use. After constructing a set of strategies,
50 individuals choose a strategy among them based on the strategy’s estimated success rate. The success
51 rate of each strategy is learned from experience in the task. With more experience, people will learn
52 the success rates of all strategies they have used in a task. This learning mechanism leads to gradual
53 changes of the estimated success rate, and these changes in turn lead to strategy selection changes. In
54 particular, the theory says that if all strategies available under the current task representation have
55 low success rates, then individuals seek other features to re-represent the task by adding or removing
56 task features from the representation. New strategies will be generated from this revised
57 representation and their success rates will be learned through experience. Critically, only strategy58
specific success rates are learned, and these strategies are based on the features incorporated into the
59 task representation at the time the strategies are created.
One reason why the RCCL theory focuses on the role of task representations in strategy selection is
61 because it was developed, in part, to explain why people exhibit base-rate neglect on some tasks but
62 not others. Lovett and Schunn (1999) argue that the tendency to neglect base-rate information is due
63 to the way people represent these tasks. RCCL explains that strategies are based on the task
64 representation, and people can only learn base rates for strategy success. If the task representation
65 does not include a feature critical for learning base rates in the task, then people will fail to learn
66 these base rates.
67 No other theory of strategy selection that we are aware of incorporates the role of a changing task
68 representation in creating and selecting strategies. Many other strategy selection theories focus
69 primarily on learning which pre-existing strategy performs better on average (Erev & Barron, 2005;
70 Rieskamp & Otto, 2006). The SCADS theory of strategy selection (Shrager & Siegler, 1998) also
71 incorporates strategy generation mechanisms, but it assumes that the task representation does not
72 change. The Rational Metareasoning (RM) theory (Lieder & Griffiths, 2017) provides an explanation
73 for how people can adjust their strategy selection based on the feature-based representation of
74 individual problems based on success rates and the execution time of strategies on prior problems
75 with similar features. The RCCL theory posits that people will develop an initial task representation
76 from the available task features, generate strategies based on those features, and drop features from
77 the representation that are not useful, and that strategies based on the current task representation are
78 the only ones that will be selected and whose estimates of success will be updated. However, unlike
79 SCADS or RM, RCCL is not a running mathematical or computational model. If the predictions that
80 RCCL makes have empirical support, then it may be worth further developing this theory due to its
81 focus on the importance of task representation changes impacting the generation and availability of
82 strategies that can be selected. The original paper supporting the RCCL theory provided support from
two studies (Lovett & Schunn, 1999), but neither study appears to have 83 been replicated since the
84 original publication, nor does it appear that the predictions of this theory have been tested in other
85 studies examining strategy selection.
86 Some of the predictions of the theory can be illustrated using the Building Sticks Task (BST) that
87 was used in the first study of the original paper (Lovett & Schunn, 1999). As shown in Figure 2, in a
88 BST problem there are three building sticks (black) and a target stick (green). The goal of the task is
89 to add and subtract the lengths of the three sticks to match the target length. A participant's strategy
90 can be categorized as either the undershoot or overshoot strategy based on the first move made on
91 each problem attempt. The undershoot strategy starts with the longest stick that is shorter than the
92 target (i.e., stick B) and then adds additional sticks to reach the target length. In contrast, the
93 overshoot strategy starts with the longest stick (i.e., stick C) and then subtracts other sticks to reach
94 the target length.
95 The original study manipulated the predictiveness of one feature of the task in addition to
96 manipulating the overall base rates of success for the overshoot and undershoot strategies.
97 Specifically, the proportion of problems solved by one strategy was varied to manipulate the base
98 rates of strategy success across conditions to create a biased condition (70% of problems solved by
99 one strategy) or an unbiased condition (50% solved by each strategy). In BST problems, there is
100 usually one stick closest to the target length, which is a salient feature of the task for participants, and
101 they will select this stick in accordance with a hill-climbing heuristic (i.e., choosing moves based on
102 which one decreases the distance to the goal the most; Lovett & Anderson, 1996). For example, in
103 Figure 2, stick C is closer to the target than stick B, so participants using the relative length cue
104 would be more likely to use the overshoot strategy. However, using the relative length cue may or
105 may not be the correct strategy for a given BST problem, and the success rate of the relative length
106 cue was also manipulated as a second factor in the original study to create a predictive condition
107 (80% predictive of a correct strategy) or an unpredictive condition (50% predictive of a correct
108 strategy).\\

109 To illustrate how the task representation affects strategy selection, consider a participant in the
110 biased-unpredictive condition that starts off by using the relative length cue as a task feature in
111 generating a strategy. The strategies generated based on this feature would be in the format of if-then
112 production rules according to RCCL. An example of such an overshoot strategy would be if the
113 overshoot stick is much closer to the goal than the undershoot stick, then select the overshoot stick
114 and try to reduce its length to match the target. An equivalent strategy could be constructed for
115 undershoot as well from this feature. In general, these strategies will turn out to be unsuccessful (50%
116 success rate), and therefore the participant drops the relative length cue feature from the task
117 representation according to the RCCL theory. The participant may identify other features of the task
118 to help select between overshoot and undershoot, but eventually all unsuccessful features would be
119 dropped. In this case, the only remaining strategies are to choose the overshoot or undershoot
120 strategy without using any problem-specific features. At this point, the participant would learn the
121 overall base rates of success for these two strategies resulting in choosing the strategy with the
122 highest base rate most often. This process is illustrated in the context of the RCCL theory on the right
123 side of Figure 1.
124 With the manipulations of base rates and cue predictiveness, RCCL's predictions are as follows: (1)
125 the relative length cue will influence participants’ initial strategy selection because salient cues are
126 more likely to be a part of the initial problem representation; (2) participants will eventually learn the
127 base rates of success of each strategy in the biased conditions; (3) participants will stop using the

relative length cue feature if it is not predictive of success; (4) more 128 task representation and strategy
129 changes will occur when the success rates of strategies are low. The relationship between strategy
130 selection and problem representation in the RCCL theory also suggests possible links between
131 individual differences that affect how people construct problem representations and select strategies.
132 2 Individual Differences Related to Problem Solving and Strategy Selection
133 Individual differences in working memory capacity as well as attentional control processes are likely
134 to affect strategy selection and problem-solving success. Working memory capacity has previously
135 been linked to success in problem solving (Ash & Wiley, 2006; Wiley & Jarosz, 2012) at least
136 partially because of its association with attentional control ability (Ash & Wiley, 2006; Draheim et
137 al., 2021; Engle & Kane, 2004; Kane et al., 2004). Attentional control is thought to be involved in
138 selecting which representations to maintain in working memory (Unsworth, 2016; Unsworth et al.,
139 2021). In addition, considering that generating the initial task representation requires attention to
140 feature saliency, strategy selection might be correlated with individual differences in the ability to
141 control attention. Attentional control may be an important aspect of both problem-solving and
142 strategy selection processes because it allows people to focus on relevant information and filter out
143 distracting information.

Previous research examining strategy selection and individual differences has identified both
145 working memory capacity and inductive reasoning as individual differences that are associated with
146 strategy selection (Schunn et al., 2001; Schunn & Reder, 2001). In a task, inductive reasoning can
147 play a role in finding an underlying pattern, which may drive both representation change and strategy
148 selection to take advantage of this pattern. People with higher working memory capacity are able to
149 hold more relevant information in working memory, which in turn can help them to choose correct
150 strategies (Schunn & Reder, 2001). However, other work found there was not a relationship between
151 working memory capacity and strategy selection, although both working memory capacity and
152 inductive reasoning were related to the awareness of base rate changes in the task (Schunn et al.,
153 2001). The inconsistent findings on whether working memory capacity is related to strategy selection
154 may be due to several factors, including differences in the tasks used to measure working memory
155 capacity and the complexity of the problems being solved. One question is whether updating strategy
156 success estimates is implicit or explicit. If the learning is implicit, it may not be affected by working
157 memory capacity and inductive reasoning because implicit learning processes such as reinforcement
158 learning may be governed by different neural systems than those associated with working memory
159 (Collins & Frank, 2012). However, if learning strategy success rates is explicit, it is more likely to be
160 associated with working memory capacity and inductive reasoning ability. Exploring these
161 relationships can help clarify the underlying mechanisms involved in strategy selection and problem162
solving.
163 Although individual differences in working memory capacity, attentional control, and inductive
164 reasoning ability could be related to strategy selection processes, it is also important to understand
165 the relationship of these individual differences to the problem-solving task itself. Doing so means
166 that individual differences associated with task performance can be considered when examining the
167 relationship of these individual differences with strategy selection in the task. For example, if
168 working memory capacity is related to performing one of the strategies because it is more demanding
169 on working memory resources, then individuals with lower working memory capacity may select
170 other strategies that have lower success rates but that demand less of working memory (Beilock &
171 DeCaro, 2007). Given the larger sample size required for examining individual differences and the
172 four between-participant conditions in the original study, in the current study we chose to focus on
primarily examining individual differences related to BST 173 problem solving. The BST is a problem174
solving task that allows individuals to experience multiple attempts on a single problem as they
175 search for the correct solution. In addition, since most problem-solving actions are captured via the
176 computer interface to the BST, it is possible to examine exploration of the problem space and its
177 association with the overall outcome (i.e., time to solve) with respect to individual differences. Prior
178 work has shown relationships between individual differences, such as working memory capacity, and
179 time to solve a problem (Ash & Wiley, 2006), but in the current study we examine more fine-grained
180 measures of problem space exploration to examine whether these measures mediate the relationship
181 between individual differences and solution time.
182 After selection of the initial move on a BST problem, the problem solver is either trying to add
183 additional sticks to the first stick or to subtract sticks from the first stick. Each move involves a
184 comparison of stick lengths to the difference between the target and current stick length. Either this
185 attempt will succeed, the problem solver will eventually decide to reset the problem and start again,
186 or a move limit is reached (set to six moves in the current study) and the task resets itself. Strategy
187 selection will occur again followed by a similar set of moves and further problem attempts until the
188 problem is solved. The current study explores whether measures of attentional control, inductive
189 reasoning ability, and working memory capacity are related to this problem-solving process.
190 While these analyses were exploratory in nature, these measures were selected based on their prior
191 use in problem-solving and strategy research and because of their plausible role in supporting the
192 BST problem-solving process. For example, inductive reasoning and working memory capacity may
193 affect an individual’s ability to reason about multiple moves in a BST problem before selecting a
194 move. Reasoning ability and working memory capacity may also play a role in reasoning about the
195 way in which prior attempts have failed when selecting moves on a subsequent problem attempt with
196 working memory playing a role in how well people can maintain and access traces of prior attempts.
197 Attentional control and working memory capacity could also play a role in maintaining a move count
198 to assess progress on the problem and how close one is to the move limit.
199 In this study, we aim to replicate one of the studies that is the primary support for the RCCL theory
200 and examine its predictions about how features in the problem environment and base-rate learning
201 influence strategy selection. We also extend this previous work to investigate whether individual
202 differences in attentional control, inductive reasoning ability, and working memory capacity are
203 related to BST problem solving and the use of the two primary strategies.

3 Materials and Methods
205 3.1 Design
206 A 2 (relative length cue predictiveness: predictive – 80%/20%; unpredictive – 50%/50%) by 2 (base
207 rate bias: biased – 70%/30%; unbiased – 50%/50%) design was used in this experiment. The study
208 consisted of a pretest, training, and posttest phase. The pretest and posttest phases are designed to
209 probe strategy preferences and are identical across all conditions. The four experimental conditions
210 only differed in the set of training BST problems that participants solved in the training phase. Table
211 1 shows the different proportion of problem types in each condition.
212 In the biased base rate conditions shown in Table 1, undershoot is the more successful strategy with
213 70% of the training problems being solved by undershoot. In the experiment, which of the two
214 strategies had the higher base rate of success was counterbalanced across participants. So there
215 actually were 8 experimental conditions when including this counterbalancing. For the unbiased
conditions, which strategy was designated as the most successful 216 strategy was also counterbalanced
217 although this did not alter the composition of the training problems because the bast rates for each
218 strategy were 50%. However, the designation of which strategy was most successful was used during
219 analysis of the data where the primary measure was how often participants selected the most
220 successful strategy based on the condition they were assigned to. Randomly assigning one of the two
221 strategies as the most successful strategy in the unbiased conditions made it possible to collapse
222 across the counterbalancing of overshoot and undershoot to analyze the differences in how often
223 participants selected the most successful strategy for their condition for all four conditions.
224 A large pool of BST problems consisting of the four problem types shown in the columns of Table 1
225 was used to select the BST problems that each participant solved during the training phase. When a
226 participant was randomly assigned to one condition, 80 BST problems were selected from the
227 problem pool according to the number of different problem types for that condition as shown in
228 Table 1. For example, if the participant was in the unbiased-predictive condition, 32 UC/US
229 problems, 8 UC/OS problems, 32 OC/OS problems, and 8 OC/US problems were selected from the
230 problem pool. Thus, the BST problem set for each participant is different but has the distribution of
231 problem types specified by the condition. This problem selection process was used to sample relevant
232 BST problems throughout the space of possible BST problems to avoid item-based effects in the data
233 that might be caused by a particular “weird” problem that affects that condition’s mean.

3.2 Participants
235 A sample of 144 undergraduate students from Mississippi State University participated for course
236 credit, and forty-four participants’ data was excluded from analyses because they did not meet the
237 criterion of 80% accuracy on parity judgement in the complex span task (N = 38) or never responded
238 correctly in complex span task (N = 4) or had more than five-time delays in the letter series task (N =
239 4). These exclusion criteria were established prior to data collection.
240 A power analysis was conducted based on the results reported by Lovett and Schunn (1999), with the
241 partial eta square being 0.35 (from Experiment 1, ANOVA interaction effect reported on p. 116).
242 This effect was selected because it was one of the smallest effect sizes reported in the paper. With a
243 significance criterion of α = .05 and power = .90, the minimum sample size needed with this effect
244 size is N = 98 for detecting this interaction. Thus, the target sample size was set to 100.
245 The study was reviewed and determined to be exempt by the Mississippi State University
246 Institutional Review Board (protocol number 19-349). Participants provided informed consent via an
247 electronic consent form presented before the study began.
248 3.3 Procedure
249 In addition to the BST, participants were given three tasks designed to measure individual
250 differences, including the antisaccade task (Kane et al., 2001), a complex span task (Barrouillet et al.,
251 2007), and a letter series completion task (Simon & Kotovsky, 1963). The antisaccade task is
252 designed to measure the ability to control attention, the complex span task was used to measure
253 working memory capacity, and the letter series task measures the ability to acquire concepts by
254 induction from examples, that is inductive reasoning ability. The entire session including all tasks
255 took 70-80 minutes to complete with up to 6 participants at a time completing the task during a single
256 session. The order of the tasks was the antisaccade task, the BST, the complex span task, and the
257 letter series task. The antisaccade task first because it required monitoring participants to ensure that
258 they were seated at the correct distance from the screen for the visual angle requirements described
below for that task. It was easier for the experimenter to monitor this requirement 259 if all participants
260 were completing the antisaccade at the same time. The remainder of the tasks were presented in the
261 same order for each participant so that fatigue effects would be similar across participants. At the
262 beginning of the experiment, participants read the consent form on the computer and then moved to
263 the antisaccade task if they consented.
264 Anti-saccade. This task assesses the ability of participants to control their attention and not look at a
265 pro-saccade stimulus in order to identify a target stimulus presented on the opposite side of the screen
266 with the task being adapted from Kane et al. (2001). Initially, the participants practiced mapping
267 responses to the keys on the number pad (1, 2, and 3) for the letters B, P, and R, respectively. They
268 had to place their left hand on the spacebar and their right hand on the number pad. A "Ready?"
269 prompt appeared on the screen, and participants started each trial by pressing the spacebar. Then after
270 400 ms a fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen. To avoid cue onset familiarity, fixation
271 times were randomly selected from 200 ms, 600 ms, 1000 ms, 1400 ms, 1800 ms, or 2200 ms
272 durations. Then the target letter was displayed for 100 ms and then replaced by a mask letter 'H' for
273 50 ms, followed by the number '8' as a second mask that would remain on the screen until
274 participants made a response. Participants would hear an audio tone for incorrect responses. There
275 were 18 trials in the practice block. Participants had to reach 80% correct or higher during the
276 practice block in order to proceed, otherwise, the practice block would continue in a loop until the
277 criterion was met or participants completed 10 times. No participant failed to meet this criterion.
After practicing the response mappings, participants received instructions on the antisaccade trials
279 and completed 18 warmup trials and 36 actual antisaccade trials. These trials were presented as a
280 single block of 54 trials. The antisaccade trials followed a similar procedure as the response mapping
281 trials that is shown in Figure 3, with a "Ready?" prompt, a fixation cross, and presentations of the
282 pro-saccade cue and anti-saccade target. The pro-saccade cue and anti-saccade target appeared in
283 opposite flanking positions, and the target was replaced by two masks (letter 'H' followed by number
284 '8') that remained on the screen until the participant made a response. The target appeared on each
285 half of the screen an equal number of times. The distance between the fixation and the closest edge of
286 each square where the target and cue appeared spanned 11.5 degrees of visual angle. An audio tone
287 was played for incorrect responses. The dependent measure was the proportion of trials in which the
288 participant correctly identified the target letter.
289 Building Sticks Task. Instructions for how to solve the problems by overshoot and undershoot
290 strategy were shown on the computer, so that participants were aware of the two basic approaches to
291 solving BST problems. The strategies were not given explicit names (e.g., undershoot) in the
292 instructions. Participants completed a set of three practice problems. For the first practice problem,
293 they were told to use start with the stick that was longer than the target (overshoot). For the second
294 practice problem, they were told to use start with a stick that was shorter than the target (undershoot).
295 For the third problem, they were not told to use a specific approach so that they had to figure out for
296 themselves which of the strategies solved the problem (the problem was solved by undershoot).
297 The task has a pretest, training, and posttest phase. The pre- and posttest phases are a set of 10 test
298 problems before and after the training phase in which participants only select the first move that they
299 would make in attempting to solve it. The purpose of this format is to assess strategy performance
300 without providing feedback about the success of the strategy. For these test problems, there were five
301 levels of the relative length cue that were each sampled twice. There were two problems with a
302 strong cue toward the undershoot strategy, two problems with a weak cue toward the undershoot
303 strategy, two neutral problems (two sticks were equally close to the target length), two problems with
a weak cue toward the overshoot strategy, and two problems 304 with a strong cue toward overshoot the
305 strategy. The distinction between a strong cue and a weak cue was based on the ratio of difference
306 between stick B and the target stick to difference between stick C and the target stick or reversely.
307 Specifically, if the ratio was greater than 3.5, then the cue was considered strong, while if the ratio
308 was around 2, then the cue was considered weak. During the training phase, participants were given
309 80 training problems based on the condition they were assigned to as shown in Table 1. Participants
310 were required to work on each of these problems until the length of the stick they were building
311 matched the length of the desired stick or they used a "reset" button to start a new solution attempt.
312 When a problem was presented, participants can click on each of the three available sticks to add it to
313 the current attempt. Each stick can be selected as many times as needed. If the current attempt is
314 longer than the target, then clicking on a building stick will subtract that stick from the current
315 attempt. If the current attempt is shorter than a target, then the clicked stick is added to the current
316 attempt. After each addition or subtraction, the current attempt stick is updated on that task interface.
317 Participants were told that all problems can be solved in 6 moves or less. The experiment
318 automatically reset the problem after 6 moves (on their seventh move). At the end of the task,
319 participants were asked to answer three questions: “How did you decide which stick to use on your
320 first attempt at the problem?”, “Did you use any particular strategies to solve these problems?”,
321 “Were there any strategies you tried that didn't seem to work? If so, please describe what you tried.”.
322 Complex Span Task. Next, participants completed a modified version of the complex span task used
323 by Barrouillet et al. (2007). First, participants were asked to complete a training phase in which they
324 would make judgements on the parity of the numbers 1-10. They had to achieve 80% accuracy to
325 continue, otherwise, they would repeat the training. In the main task, participants were presented
326 with a series of letters ranging in length from one to seven, with three series of each length. The
327 series were presented in ascending order with all the one-length series presented before moving on to
328 the two-length series and so on. The 21 series contained a total of 84 letters, each followed by a series
329 of 4, 6, or 8 integers from 1 to 10. The numbers appeared in a fixed random order, with as many even
330 as odd numbers. Participants were required to remember the letters in order and judge the parity for
331 digits. After “Recall” appeared on the screen, participants would press the keys corresponding to the
332 letters they were to remember. Before the main task began, one example of how to respond to digits
333 and recall a letter was shown to participants. Participants were instructed and prompted to keep parity
334 judgement at or above 80% accuracy in the main trials (which was established as a data exclusion
335 criterion prior to the study). Feedback on accuracy was presented after recall for each series of letters.

Letter Series Task. Finally, participants completed the letter series task (Simon & Kotovsky, 1963).
337 Two examples of letter series with one rule and two rules were presented, and participants were
338 presented with the letter series, rule(s), and answer for these examples. Then a practice trial was
339 provided (e.g., “B, V, D, X, F, Z, H, B, ?"), and participants were guided to find the pattern within
340 the letters. They were given feedback and taken back re-read the instructions if they did not respond
341 correctly to this practice trial. There were 15 trials. The letters in each trial change according to a
342 fixed pattern which could include more than one rule (e.g., “V, V, F, X, X, H, Z, Z, J, B, B, L, D, D,
343 ?”). Participants were required to complete each trial in one minute or less. Participants were not able
344 to go back once they submitted an answer. If they responded too quickly (less than 10 seconds) and
345 gave a wrong answer, a compulsory delay of 15 s would be triggered. Once participants triggered the
346 delay more than 5 times, their data were excluded from data analyses. The delay was included to
347 discourage answering quickly without attempting to figure out the answer.
349 4 Results
350 4.1 Data Analysis
351 For the pre- and posttest data, participants only selected the first move. Analyses of these data
352 focused on whether participants selected the move consistent with the overshoot or undershoot
353 strategy. Problems in which participants selected stick A were not included in the analyses (2.8% of
354 the data) because stick A was not considered to be using the undershoot strategy as described in the
355 task instructions. Based on the base-rate bias condition to which participants were assigned, one of
356 the two strategies was designated as the successful strategy. In the biased conditions, half of the
357 participants were randomly assigned to experience more problems solved by undershoot, and the
358 other half experienced more problems solved by overshoot. Therefore, the successful strategy for
359 these two groups of participants was undershoot and overshoot, respectively. In the unbiased
360 conditions, participants experienced half of the problems solved by each strategy. In this case, half of
361 the participants were randomly assigned to have the undershoot strategy designated as the successful
362 strategy, and the other half were assigned the overshoot strategy as the successful strategy. Coding
363 the data in this manner made it possible to analyze the data across counterbalance conditions and is
364 identical to how the data were analyzed in the original study (Lovett & Schunn, 1999). For example,
365 it is possible to assess whether participants selected the strategy for which the base rate was higher in
366 the biased condition without regard to whether the strategy with the higher base rate was undershoot
367 or overshoot.
A separate set of analyses used the training phase data, during which participants had to solve each
369 problem to move on to the next problem. Because it may take multiple attempts to solve a problem, it
370 is possible to examine how many of the attempts that participants made were unique (as opposed to
371 repeating a series of moves that was tried previously on that problem). In addition, unsuccessful
372 attempts can be terminated by the participant clicking the reset button (i.e., manual reset) or by
373 making more than 6 moves resulting in the system forcing the problem to be reset (i.e., forced reset).
374 For the training phase data, dependent measures include the strategy that was first selected, solution
375 time, proportion of the attempts that were unique, and the number of forced and manual resets.
376 The data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects models including participant and item
377 random effects unless otherwise noted. Analyses were performed in R using the lme4 and lmerTest
378 packages (Bates et al., 2015; Kuznetsova et al., 2017). The lmerTest package provides p-values for
379 fixed effects based on the Satterthwaite approximation. Factor variables were coded using deviation
380 contrast coding (e.g., -.5/.5). For all models, a maximal random effects model was initially used (Barr
381 et al., 2013), with participant random intercepts and any within-participant conditions modelled as
382 random slopes for participant. If the model did not converge, then the random effects structure was
383 reduced. While the power analysis determining sample size was based on an ANOVA as was used in
384 the original paper, generalized linear mixed effects models were used because it is possible to
385 formulate models that generally test the same effects as the original ANOVAs while also better
386 representing that in many cases, the dependent measure is a binary outcome (e.g., was a certain
387 strategy selected). In many cases in the original paper, a proportion measure was used in an ANOVA
388 as if it were a continuous response.
389 The high rate of exclusion for the complex span task (N=38) is discussed in the supplementary
390 analyses available at https://osf.io/8w4kd. Analyses with these participants included are presented
391 there, and in all cases there is no difference in the statistical significance of the results reported here
392 with these participants excluded from analyses.

4.2 Replication 393 of Original Findings
394 4.2.1 Sensitivity to Cue Predictiveness
395 The first prediction from RCCL was that the relative length cue would influence participants’ initial
396 strategy selection. In the BST, the stick that is closest to the target is a salient cue associated with
397 strategy selection. As described, there were five types of problems on the pre- and posttest: strong
398 cue toward overshoot, weak cue toward overshoot, neutral, weak cue toward undershoot, and strong
399 cue toward overshoot. These problem types were recoded based on the most successful strategy as
400 designated by the condition the participant was assigned to (e.g., strong cue toward the most
401 successful strategy). For the pretest, if participants were sensitive to the length cue, there would be a
402 higher proportion of successful strategy selection for those problems in which there is a more salient
403 relative length cue predictive of a successful strategy. If not, the proportion of successful strategy
404 selection would be a flat line around 50%. The mean proportion of the time that the successful
405 strategy was selected is shown in Figure 4 where it can be seen that participants were sensitive to the
406 length cue in the predicted manner.
407 The trial-level data were analyzed in a logistic generalized linear mixed effects model, with the
408 dependent measure being whether the successful strategy was selected for each problem. The relative
409 length cue was coded from -2 = strong cue toward unsuccessful strategy to 2 = strong cue toward
410 successful strategy. The generalized linear mixed model showed that the relative length cue had a
411 positive effect on the proportion of successful strategy (b = 1.03, SE = .29, 95% CI [0.46, 1.61], z =
412 3.52, p < .001), which is consistent with the original finding. Increasing one unit on the relative
413 length cue scale therefore results in a 2.80 increase in the odds of selecting the successful strategy.
4.2.2 Sensitivity to Base Rates
415 The second prediction was that participants would learn the base rates of success of each strategy. If
416 participants learned the biased base rate during training, they would show sensitivity to the base rates
417 in their strategy selection on the posttest. The biased base rate conditions were compared to the
418 unbiased base rate conditions to test if biased base rates influenced successful strategy selection. To
419 examine this prediction, a generalized linear mixed model was used with the dependent measure
420 being whether the most successful strategy was selected, and the predictors included the base rate
421 bias condition (unbiased/biased), the cue predictiveness condition (unpredictive/predictive), and test
422 time (pre/posttest). The model fit is shown in Table 2, and the results demonstrated that participants
423 in the biased base rates conditions chose the biased strategy more often than those in the unbiased
424 conditions. This result is also consistent with the original findings. Critically, the differences between
425 the base rate bias conditions (unbiased/biased) in the posttest were not caused by differences in
426 pretest strategy selection because there is an interaction between the bias condition and test time.
427 This interaction is driven by there being no difference in successful strategy selection at pretest
428 between the biased and unbiased conditions (b = .07, SE = .15, z = .45, p = .97), but at posttest, the
429 biased condition had a higher rate of successful strategy selection than the unbiased condition (b =
430 .46, SE = .15, z = 3.16, p = .009). This interaction is shown in Figure 5, indicating that participants
431 learned the base rates during training.
432 4.2.3 Irrelevant Cues are Dropped
433 The third prediction was that people would stop using task features that do not lead to successful
434 strategies. According to the RCCL theory, if one feature was not useful, participants should drop it
435 from their task representation. Specifically, on the pretest, participants were found to be sensitive to
436 the relative length cue, as shown in Figure 4. Then after the training phase, participants who were in
the unpredictive conditions should be less sensitive to the length cue 437 because it was not useful. With
438 cue predictiveness and base rate bias conditions as between-subjects factors and relative length cue
439 and test time as within-subjects variables, the generalized linear mixed model showed that there was
440 an interaction between the cue predictiveness factor and the relative length cue (b = .21, SE = .08, z =
441 2.71, p = .007). As shown in Figure 6, this interaction was due to participants in the unpredictive
442 conditions being less sensitive to the relative length cue at posttest than at pretest (b = .24, SE = .10, z
443 = 2.31, p = .02), but those in predictive conditions did not show a decrease in sensitivity to the
444 relative length cue (b = .08, SE = .11, z = 0.73, p = .47).
445 In addition, the responses to the questions about strategies asked at the end of the BST were coded
446 according to the same coding scheme as in the original paper (Lovett and Schunn, 1999). Based on
447 the keywords in the responses, the responses were categorized into three major groups: Length,
448 Exclusive, and Other. Participants who made comparisons between Stick B or C and the desired stick
449 were classified as using a length-sensitive procedure (Length). Participants were categorized as using
450 exclusive strategy if a participant said they "always" or "usually" used one single strategy
451 (Exclusive). The remaining responses were categorized as miscellaneous (Other). The inter-rater
452 reliability between two judges was acceptable with a Cohen’s Kappa value of .92.
453 The proportion of responses falling into each of these three categories for each condition is shown in
454 Table 3. As some evidence that participants’ reported strategies corresponded to behavior,
455 participants reporting using the length cue were more likely to select the strategy corresponding to
456 the relative length cue in the training problems relative to the other two categories combined, F(1,
457 98) = 5.45, p = .02. Participants in the unpredictive cue conditions had significantly fewer responses
458 related to the length cue (45%, averaged over the levels of the base rate bias conditions) than
459 participants in the predictive conditions (69%, averaged over the levels of the base rate bias
460 conditions), 2 = 10.79, p = .001. This result supports the prediction that irrelevant features will be
461 dropped when they are not predictive of success.

4.2.4 More Representation Change
463 The fourth prediction was that there would be more representation change in conditions where
464 success rates are low. To quantify the change in task representation, a matrix method was used, as in
465 the original study, to calculate the degree to which a participant has shifted in a two-dimensional
466 representation space during the training phase of the experiment. The training problems were broken
467 up into four blocks of 20 problems each for this analysis. The horizontal dimension of the matrix
468 represented participants' sensitivity to the relative length cue during each block, with the proportion
469 of choosing the closest stick determining the position on this axis. Participants who were further from
470 zero were more sensitive to the relative length cue. The vertical dimension of the matrix represented
471 participants’ sensitivity to the base rates, with the proportion of choosing the successful strategy
472 corresponding to their assigned condition. Participants who were further from zero were more
473 sensitive to the base rate. By dividing 80 training problems into four blocks, it is possible to see how
474 participants’ choices changed over the course of training as four points in the matrix. The rationale
475 underlying this analysis is that choices are made based on strategies which are in turn composed from
476 the represented task features. The change in task representation over the course of training could be
477 characterized as the distance between each point in the two-dimensional matrix. Figure 7 shows
478 examples for the choice patterns of four participants during the training phase.
479 According to the RCCL theory, the unbiased-unpredictive condition should have limited success
480 because there were no features such as the relative length cue that were predictive of strategy success
481 and both strategies had the same base rate of success. Therefore, there should be more representation
changes in this specific condition. The results showed that the representations 482 of the participants in
483 the unbiased-unpredictive condition (M = .71, SD = .16) covered more distance than the other three
484 conditions combined (M = .58, SD = .21), F(1, 98) = 8.09, p = .005.
485 To verify that there was overall less success in initial strategy selection for the unbiased-unpredictive
486 condition, whether the correct initial stick (overshoot or undershoot) was selected as the first move
487 for the first attempt on each training problem was examined in a generalized linear mixed effect
488 model contrasting the success rates in all other conditions to the success rate for the unbiased489
unpredictive condition. The results showed that success rates in the unbiased-unpredictive condition
490 (M = .64, SD = .10) were lower than the other three conditions combined (M = .69, SD = .10), z = -
491 2.54, p = .01.
492 4.3 Individual Differences Results
493 Descriptive statistics for each of the individual difference measures are shown in Table 4. All
494 individual differences measures were converted to z-scores prior to including them in any statistical
495 models. To examine whether individual differences were related to initial strategy selection in BST
496 problem solving, we first focused on the role of individual differences in initial cue use. The
497 proportion of choosing the overshoot strategy during the pretest phase was examined using a linear
498 mixed effects model with predictors for relative length cue and the three individual differences. The
499 relative length cue was included to see if there was a difference in sensitivity to the relative length
500 cue for individuals varying on any of the individual difference measures, as shown by an interaction
501 between the relative length cue and one or more of the individual differences. No significant
502 interactions were found, indicating no evidence for a role of these individual differences in initial cue
503 use. However, individuals with higher inductive reasoning ability chose the overshoot strategy more
504 often than those who were lower on the inductive reasoning measure (b = .03, SE = .01, t = 1.92, p =
505 .05). There were no significant relationships between the proportion of choosing the overshoot
506 strategy and attentional control (b = .02, SE = .01, t = 1.34, p = .18) or working memory capacity (b =
507 .01, SE = .01, t = 1.09, p = .28). This result may indicate some differences between the overshoot and
508 undershoot strategies where the overshoot strategy may be a bit more demanding of cognitive
509 resources.
Problem-solving performance during the training phase was then examined in an exploratory analysis
511 to identify individual differences related to BST problem solving. One of the goals of this set of
512 analyses was to identify relationships that could be explored in further hypothesis-driven research. In
513 addition, the goal is to understand the role these individual differences may play in BST problem
514 solving before conducting future research examining the relationship of these individual differences
515 to strategy selection and representation change processes.
516 Solution time was first examined to determine if any individual differences had an influence on it.
517 The model fit shown in Table 5 showed that inductive reasoning ability and attentional control both
518 had a significant effect on solution time, with higher attentional control and inductive reasoning
519 ability associated with faster solution times. In addition, being in the predictive condition also led to
520 faster solution times.
521 To provide some further constraints on the mechanisms by which these individual differences
522 influence solution time, the proportion of unique attempts and the proportion of resets that were
523 forced resets were examined as mediators of the effect of the individual difference measures on
524 solution time. The rationale was that measures such as the proportion of unique attempts provide
525 measures of how effectively participants are searching the problem space, and individual differences
may be affecting this search process, which in turn impacts 526 solution time. The proportion of resets
527 that were forced resets may indicate the degree to which participants are monitoring problem-solving
528 progress on their own as compared to relying on the maximum moves built into the task interface. In
529 addition, the condition that participants were assigned to was included in this analysis as a predictor
530 of solution time and a predictor of the mediating variables because the problem distribution in each
531 condition may have influenced these variables. Figure 8 displays the results of this mediation
532 analysis excluding the condition predictors in the visualization for ease of interpretation. There was a
533 significant path from inductive reasoning ability to the proportion of unique attempts to solution time
534 (𝑏 = -.02, z = -2.22, p = .03), and there was a significant path from attentional control to forced resets
535 to solution time (𝑏 = -.02, z = -2.31, p = .02).
536 5 Discussion
537 The goals of this experiment were to examine how task representations influence strategy selection
538 and explore how individual differences in attentional control, inductive reasoning ability, and
539 working memory capacity are related to BST problem-solving. The results can be summarized as
540 follows: (1) people are sensitive to a salient feature of the task in their initial representation, (2)
541 people are sensitive to the base rate of strategy success, (3) people tend to drop features from the task
542 representation that are found not to be useful, (4) there are more representation changes when success
543 rates are low, and (5) individual differences in attentional control, working memory capacity, and
544 inductive reasoning ability are related to BST problem-solving performance, in both direct and
545 indirect ways. The first four of these results replicate prior results (Lovett & Schunn, 1999). The
546 prior study was one of the few to directly test the RCCL theory. Therefore, the current replication of
547 those results provides further support for that theory.
548 The first prediction from the RCCL theory is that salient features in a task influence the initial task
549 representation. For BST problems, the specific prediction was that the relative length cue would
550 influence participants’ initial strategy selection because it is the most salient cue in the task, and it
551 will be a part of the initial problem representation. The upward linear curve in Figure 4 is an
552 indication of individuals' sensitivity to the relative length cue. In other words, this salient feature
553 influences individuals' task representations and strategy selection, which is a replication of the
554 original finding (Lovett & Schunn, 1999). This finding is also in line with other work showing the
555 role of salient features in strategy selection (Proctor et al., 1992).
The second prediction from the RCCL theory is that individuals will learn the success rate of each
557 strategy. With more experience in the BST, participants will eventually learn the success rate of each
558 strategy in the biased conditions, and they will show sensitivity to the biased base rates in their
559 strategy selection in the posttest. Indeed, biased base rates influenced successful strategy selection,
560 with individuals in the biased conditions selecting strategies having higher rates of success more
561 often. This base-rate sensitivity was caused by learning in the training phase rather than any
562 differences between condition in pretest strategy selection. One of the main reasons for developing
563 the RCCL theory was a finding that base-rate neglect on problem-solving and decision-making tasks
564 depends on whether the problem is presented as a text-based summary of frequencies or probabilities
565 or whether people experience the trial-by-trial frequencies from which success rates can be learned
566 (Bar-Hillel, 1980; Kahneman & Tversky, 1973). The current result showing sensitivity to base rates
567 replicates the original finding (Lovett & Schunn, 1999).
568 The third prediction from the RCCL theory is that if current strategies have low success rates, then
569 individuals will re-represent the task by adding or removing task features from the representation. In
the BST, individuals will learn to drop the relative length cue from their task re 570 presentation if it is not
571 predictive of success. Both self-report data and behavioral data were used to examine this prediction.
572 First, the results of the self-reports showed that individuals were less likely to use length-based cues
573 in the unpredictive conditions relative to the predictive conditions. In addition, individuals who
574 reported using stick length showed more sensitivity to the relative length cue than individuals who
575 reported using the other two categories of strategies (exclusivity and other reports). These findings
576 are consistent with the original findings (Lovett & Schunn, 1999). Choice behavior in the posttest
577 showed that participants were less sensitive to the relative length cue in the unpredictive conditions.
578 Sensitivity was quantified as the slope of the individual's choice proportions against the relative
579 length cue (e.g., the slope of the curve in Figures 4 and 6), and the slopes in the unpredictive
580 conditions became flatter from pretest to posttest. These findings indicate that individuals are
581 reducing their use of the relative length cue when it is not useful, supporting the prediction made by
582 RCCL that people will remove useless features from the task representation.
583 However, other feature-based strategy selection theories, such as rational metareasoning (RM)
584 theory, can also be used to interpret these results (Lieder & Griffiths, 2017). In RM’s account of
585 strategy selection, the mapping from features to a strategy’s value is learned from experience via a set
586 of weights between the features and the expected cost and reward of the strategy. This learning
587 mechanism can transfer the learned weights from prior problem solving to pick effective strategies
588 for novel problems that have similar feature values. According to RM, people can learn that a feature
589 is not predictive of success, not necessarily because they drop the feature from the representation, but
590 the weight between the feature and the cost and reward of the strategy could be updated to be zero.
591 Therefore, RM can also account for these results by simply learning that the feature is not relevant to
592 strategy selection. We cannot differentiate the RCCL theory from RM within the current study design
593 because it is not possible to assess whether the feature has been removed from the task representation
594 or if it is in the task representation but not affecting strategy selection. It may not be possible to distinguish between removing a feature from the task representation and
596 updating the weight of the feature to zero. However, RCCL explains representation change as a
597 discrete process. For example, if the relative length cue is removed from the task representation, then
598 it is no longer possible to create or select strategies that rely on this feature. On the other hand,
599 learning the mapping between features and strategy value in RM would occur in a more continuous
600 manner as experiences update the relevant weights. At least in aggregate, the posttest data shown in
601 the unpredictive column of Figure 6 do not seem to reflect a discrete removal of the relative length
602 cue from the task representation and may reflect a decrease in the importance of the relative length
603 cue instead. The design of the current study was not intended to look at the rate of this change
604 process, but it may be possible to do so in future work.
605 The fourth prediction from the RCCL theory is that there will be more representation change in tasks
606 when strategy success rates are low. The task representation is used to generate strategies, and the
607 success rate of each strategy is learned by experience in the task. This learning mechanism leads to
608 gradual changes in the estimated success rate, and these changes in turn lead to representation
609 changes which affect the available strategies. Thus, when success rates learned for used strategies are
610 low, people will change the task representation by adding or removing features from the task
611 representation. In the BST, more task representation changes are expected to occur in the unbiased612
unpredictive condition because neither base rates nor the relative length cue lead to high success. The
613 results did show that there was more representation change in the unbiased-unpredictive condition
614 than in other conditions. However, a caveat should be made concerning the conclusion that there are
615 more representation changes in low success rates. When testing if there are more strategy changes if
the success rate is low, the unbiased-unpredictive condition was compared w 616 ith all other conditions
617 as was done in the original study. But taking both the predictive and biased factors into consideration,
618 there was no interaction between biased base rates and cue predictiveness. It may be that individuals
619 in the unpredictive conditions have more representation changes, and there may not be more
620 representation change in the unbiased-unpredictive condition than in the biased-unpredictive
621 condition. A possible explanation for this result may be that the relative length cue is a salient cue in
622 the task, and when it is not helpful, individuals tend to find other features to replace it. It may also be
623 that the current study did not have sufficient statistical power to detect the interaction.
624 The method used to examine representation change as shown in Figure 7 also has its limitations. This
625 grid method intends to examine representation change reflected in choices that are controlled by
626 strategies. The relative length cue does seem to be a feature that could be incorporated into the task
627 representation. However, the rate of selecting the most successful of the overshoot/undershoot
628 solution methods is more difficult to conceptualize as a representation change. According to RCCL,
629 success rates of generated strategies are learned via experience, but the theory does not commit to
630 whether these are explicitly represented or learned via some implicit mechanism (e.g., reinforcement
631 learning). Even if the base rate is explicitly represented, it would be the base rate of specific
632 strategies and not necessarily the overall base rate of success of the initial selection of the overshoot
633 or undershoot stick. Therefore, the base rate dimension of the grid may not reflect representation
634 change. This analysis is also limited in that it only considers one (or two) potential task features, and
635 if people are searching for new features that are not these features, then the analysis does not capture
636 this variation. While this analysis does replicate the original result, there are limitations to it which
637 make it difficult to fully evaluate this prediction of RCCL. In summary, the current study replicates
638 the findings of the previous experiment with respect to all four predictions of the RCCL theory with
639 some important limitations, and other theories such as RM also seem compatible with the results.
640 While the current study focused on replication of prior results with the BST task, the original paper
641 also reported supporting results in another task, the Colors task (Lovett & Schunn, 1999). In this task,
642 participants were presented with a cue and a pair of choices with the choices being probabilistically
643 rewarded. The task had four experimental conditions differentiated by two main factors: number of
644 colors (either a two-color or four-color version of the task) and reward probabilities (these were given
645 in pairs, either “67/33” or “80/50”). In the two-colors condition, the cue was either a colored red or
646 green square and the response options were always red and green squares. In the 67/33 condition, the
647 red response option was always rewarded 67% of the time and the green option 33% of the time
648 (regardless of the cue color). In the 80/50 condition, for the red cue, the red option was rewarded
649 80% of the time and the green option 20% of the time. For the green cue, both options were rewarded
650 50% of the time. The four-color version of the task operated with the same probability structure
651 except that the cues were blue and yellow (so that they did not match the color of the response
652 options).
653 According to RCCL, in the two-colors condition, one of the choice colors matched the cue color, so
654 participants would tend to represent the task as matching or not matching the cue and their strategies
655 would be to either match the cue or not. In the four-color condition, participants would not represent
656 the task as matching and so would be better able to learn cue-specific response probabilities. The
657 findings matched this prediction, with participants in the two-color condition being more sensitive to
658 base-rates of matching and participants in the four-color condition being more sensitive to cue
659 specific response probabilities (Lovett & Schunn, 1999).

Overall, this task did introduce different strategies by manipulating f 660 eatures across different
661 conditions, leading to distinct choice behaviors based on participants’ task representation, such as
662 whether they represented the match/mismatch feature. The results supported the RCCL theory’s
663 prediction that different strategies are generated in terms of different task representation. Moreover,
664 initial task representations were more obvious in this task, which could help identify the
665 representation changes. As such, the predictions made by the RCCL were tested in two relatively
666 straightforward tasks. Despite the tasks’ simplicity, the implications of the RCCL theory are not
667 limited to the BST. It will be important to examine the generality of this theory in tasks that go
668 beyond the original work including tasks with a larger space of possible strategies. One challenge
669 with examining such tasks is that it is often difficult to know exactly what strategy a participant is
670 using when the space of strategies is larger (Moss et al., 2022).
671 5.1 Individual Differences Related to BST Problem Solving
672 In addition to replicating prior results, another goal of the current study was to examine relationships
673 between individual differences in working memory capacity, attentional control, and inductive
674 reasoning ability to BST problem-solving. In this study, we used the proportion of unique attempts,
675 the proportion of forced resets, and solution time as measures of problem-solving performance.
676 Problem solution time is a less granular measure of problem-solving performance that can potentially
677 be explained by the more granular measures related to problem space exploration such as the
678 proportion of unique attempts and forced resets in the BST task. In this task, problem solving may
679 consist of many attempts to solve the problem, but only one solution works. Across these attempts,
680 participants sometimes repeat an attempt from earlier. In addition, this task was programmed to force
681 a reset on participants’ seventh move during an attempt, and the instructions for the task stated that
682 all problems can be solved within five moves. The proportion of unique attempts and forced resets
683 reflect how effectively people explore the problem space for each problem (Newell & Simon, 1972)
684 and how they may be monitoring their solution attempt. Specifically, a higher proportion of unique
685 attempts indicates that participants are more likely to maintain the traces of prior attempts and avoid
686 repeating prior attempts. Similarly, a lower proportion of forced resets may indicate that participants
687 are monitoring how many moves have been made to evaluate their progress toward a solution such
688 that avoid being forced to reset.
In the regression model relating the individual differences to solution time shown in Table 5, only
690 attentional control and inductive reasoning are significant predictors of solution time. Considering
691 that the proportion of unique attempts and forced resets could potentially explain solution time, we
692 also included these two measures in the mediation model as mediators. Individual differences in
693 attentional control and inductive reasoning ability influenced solution time but were mediated by the
694 proportion of forced resets and the proportion of unique attempts, respectively. Higher inductive
695 reasoning ability was associated with a higher proportion of unique attempts, leading to faster
696 solution time. One interpretation is that participants are reasoning about the failure of past attempts to
697 plan the next attempt, which helps to constrain search in a manner that reduces the chance of
698 repeating an earlier attempt.
699 Participants with higher attentional control had fewer forced resets, leading to faster solution time.
700 This mediation can be explained by the fact that attentional control resources are being used to
701 monitor the number of moves made so that reaching a forced reset is less likely. Attentional control
702 has been discussed as the ability to control the information that gets maintained in working memory
703 in the face of distraction (Unsworth, 2016; Unsworth et al., 2021). In the antisaccade task, this
704 control allows the goal of attending to the opposite side of the screen to be maintained and influence
action selection in the face of the prepotent response to move one’s 705 eyes to the blinking distractor. In
706 the BST, this process may allow for a move counter to be maintained while also executing planned
707 moved and planning future moves.
708 Finally, there was no effect of working memory capacity on problem-solving measures. This result
709 is not aligned with other work, which found that individual differences in WMC are related to the
710 ability to retrieve previous task experience which then contributes to task performance (Mattarella-
711 Micke & Beilock, 2010; Wiley & Jarosz, 2012). One possibility for the nonsignificant result is that
712 working memory capacity is correlated with attentional control, and the latter accounts for the effects
713 on problem-solving performance (Ash & Wiley, 2006; Engle & Kane, 2004; Kane et al., 2001). As
714 such, it is reasonable to suggest that solution time is not influenced by the unique variance of
715 working memory capacity that is not shared with attentional control and inductive reasoning. As
716 expected, all the task measures were somewhat correlated with the antisaccade and complex span
717 measures sharing 25% of their variance. As shown in a supplemental material, when working
718 memory capacity alone is used to predict solution time, then there is a significant relationship, but if
719 either of the other two individual differences are included, then this relationship is not significant.
720 Therefore, the lack of a relationship with working memory capacity in the current study could be
721 attributed to variance better accounted for by the inductive reasoning and attentional control
722 measures. The interpretation of the individual differences is also limited by the use of a single task to measure
724 these three related latent constructs. There is always the concern that the correlations we observed
725 could be due to task variance unassociated with the latent construct. In addition, the status of
726 attentional control as a singular construct is very much an open question. We selected the antisaccade
727 task because of its reliability and that it generally loads highly on an attentional control factor in
728 other research (Draheim et al., 2021). Traditional tasks that have been used to measure attentional
729 control suffer from low reliability and do not correlate with each other (Hedge et al., 2018; Rouder &
730 Haaf, 2019). There are different proposals on how best to measure attentional control given these
731 concerns including relying on accuracy-based measures such as the antisaccade rather than on
732 differences in response times such as in a Stroop task (Burgoyne et al., 2023; Draheim et al., 2021).
733 Researchers examining the related construct of cognitive control have also noted that there are
734 multiple mechanisms or dimensions by which individuals could adjust to task demands (Frömer &
735 Shenhav, 2022; Ritz et al., 2022), but it remains to be seen whether it is possible to measure reliable
736 individual differences along these dimensions.
737 Although the present results are consistent with the original findings, they also raise some new
738 questions. For example, we found that participants showed sensitivity to the relative length cue in the
739 pretest, but there was also a relationship between inductive reasoning ability and use of the overshoot
740 strategy. It is not clear why this relationship exists. In the BST, we can consider the overshoot
741 strategy as subtraction and the undershoot strategy as addition. The preference for undershoot could
742 be induced by the preference for addition rather than subtraction (Adams et al., 2021). Inductive
743 reasoning, a core component of fluid intelligence, is also closely tied to math performance (Kinshuk
744 et al., 2006). And using a subtraction procedure has been found to be more difficult than addition
745 (Barrouillet et al., 2008; Campbell & Xue, 2001; Kamii et al., 2001). People with higher inductive
746 reasoning ability might be better at using subtraction or more willing to engage in the reasoning
747 required to plan a subtraction solution, which can be the reason why they choose overshoot strategy
748 more.
It is noted that the individual difference analyses in the current 749 paper were exploratory analyses, and
750 it was not feasible to examine the relationships between individual differences and base-rate learning
751 in only a subset of the conditions, such as in the biased-unpredictive condition. Examination of
752 individual differences in the rate at which people shift toward more useful task representations and
753 strategies with that kind of comparison was not possible in the current study given that each cell of
754 the design had only 25 participants. Importantly, exploring the relationships between individual
755 differences and problem-solving performance should provide a basis for examining how these
756 individual differences play a role in strategy development and selection in future research using BST
757 problems to explore strategy selection. Verifying that the results of prior research could be replicated
758 was a prerequisite to conducting a higher-powered study examining the role of individual differences.
759 This future work would also be better able to address the question of whether strategy success
760 estimates are maintained and updated explicitly or implicitly by examining individual differences
761 related to adapting to base rates.
762 To conclude, in spite of some limitations, we have tested the predictions made by the RCCL theory
763 and replicated the original findings from Lovett and Schunn (1999). However, the RCCL theory
764 needs further development to test more specific predictions, and some of the results may be better
765 explained by other strategy selection theories such as RM. Individual differences were also found to
766 be related to BST strategy use and problem-solving performance. Based on the present findings,
767 future research can focus on exploring strategy preferences and establishing a more thorough
768 understanding of how individual differences are related to strategy development and selection.
